In this project I am demontrating response to the quetion that the researchers have specified no preplanned means comparison, but wish to make all pairwise comparisons to help interpret the results. In this project, I am analyzing the data and conclude a brief statistical report including a summary of statistical conclusions, graphical display(s), and a section describing the details of the particular methods used.



Summary of statistical solution, full analysis solution is attached as a file.




•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Breast and Bronchus cancers shows that there is a strong convincing evidence that increase was estimated to 1184 days from 666 to 1702 days with the 95% confidence. The p-value < .0001.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Breast and Colon shows that there is strong convincing evidence that increase was estimated to 938.5 days from 420 to 1456 days with 95% confidence. The p-value is equal to 0.0006.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer among the two groups of Breast and Ovary shows that there is a suggestive but not inclusive evidence that increase was estimated to 511 days from -168 to 1191 days with 95% confidence interval. The p-value is equal to 0.1.


•	 Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Breast and Stomach shows that there is a strong convincing evidence that the increase was estimated to 1109 days from 561 to 1659 days with 95% confidence. The p-value equal to 0.0002.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Bronchus and colon shows that there is NO evidence that decrease estimated to 245 days from -705 to 214 days of 95 % confidence. P-value equals to 0.3.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Bronchus and Ovary shows that there is a moderate evidence that increase was estimated to 672 days from 36.6 to 1308 days of 95 % confidence interval. The p-value equals to 0.04.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Bronchus and Stomach shows that there is NO evidence that increase was estimated 74 days from -568 to 419 days with 95% confidence. P-value equals to 0.8.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Colon and Ovary shows that there is No evidence that increase estimated to 426 days from -1063 to 209 with 95% confidence. The p-value equals to 0.2.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Colon and stomach shows that there is NO evidence that the increase was estimated to 171 days from -322 to 665 days with 95% confidence. P-value equals to 0.5.


•	Contrasting the Survival time and Organ affected by cancer of two groups, Ovary and Stomach shows that there is a suggestive but inconclusive evidence that the increase was estimated to 598 days from -63 to 1259.6 days with 95 % confidence-value equals to 0.07.
